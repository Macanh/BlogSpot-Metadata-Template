# BlogSpot-Metadata-Template
Blogspot template with Schema microdata modifications

A BlogSpot (Google Blogger) template modified to eliminate Schema.org errors when testing with Gooble's Structured Data Testing Tool (SDTT) as of January 29, 2016.

This is a standard "Simple" Template created by Designer: Josh Peterson (URL:www.noaesthetic.com), which seems to retain all of the functionality of the "Blogger Template Designer".

Intended for those wishing to start a new Blogger blog. 

*** WARNING: Installing over an existing blog will destroy your existing layout and other preferences. 

Customizations:

There are six instances for the images that Google's (SDTT) requires.  Search the within the template for "Schema Mods:" to locate those areas and provide images for your Blog and Organization.  (Dummy are currently images in those two sections)

There is also a commented area in the <Head> section for providing your Google Plus identity.
